### Interests

I'm a tech lover, I love cinema, music and sports in general.

I discovered [bitcointalk](https://bitcointalk.org/) in 2012 and I fell in love with the idea of crypto and bitcoin, I followed all the incredible develops of bitcoin and crypto in these years.

Super interested in coding and in particular to make Rust my daily tool for coding. I hope to get a chance to have a call with Blockstream to try to fulfill my dream of making Bitcoin my daily work.
