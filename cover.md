Dear Hiring Manger,

I am delighted to apply for this position in Blockstream. I have 20 years of experience in software/firmware development in embedded electronics: I started in the mobile phone industry as software developer and than developed my skills in other companies always related to embedded software development.

I discovered bitcoin in 2012 and I fell in love with all discussions on bitcointalk and still believe that crypto space have plenty of space of growth. I always followed in these years the incredible path of bitcoin and of many companies born on the top of it and it's still incredible in my eyes. Now I want to try to enter with my hands in these sector. I was hesitant to candidate in these years because I think that my experiences were not perfectly matching crypto space, but now I want to give myself an opportunity and surely Blockstream is a top notch opportunity. Just thinking that is leaded by Mr. Back gives me shivers.

What makes me think that I could be a good candidate for this position is that I always been a super curious and motivated developer. I worked in many sectors of electronics from mobile phone to consumer electronics boards and always developed in C/C++ now I fell in love with Rust and I want to make it my daily tool for working and keep growing my learning curve of this language at a fast pace.

I know that I am no more a young guy and this is a fact, surely you'll receive a lot of applications from younger candidates for this amazing position in Blockstream, but I think that my experience as a software developer could be a plus: I am confident with many tools, IDE, source control and bugtracking and I come from many years of teamworking with local and international teams. Beside tech skills I consider myself a

I really hope that you'll consider my application a give me a chance to have a call or a meeting with your team. It would be such an honor for me
