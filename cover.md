Dear Hiring Manger,

I am delighted to apply for this position in Blockstream. I have 20 years of experience in software/firmware develop in embedded electronics: I started in the mobile phone industry as software developer and than developed my skills in other companies always related to embedded software development.

I discovered bitcoin in 2012 and I fell in love with all discussions on bitcointalk and still believe that crypto space have plenty of space of growth. I always followed in these years the incredible path of bitcoin and of many companies born on the top of it and it's still incredible in my eyes. Now I want to try to enter with my hands in these sector, I was hesitant to candidate in these years because I think that my experiences were not perfectly matching crypto space, but now I want to give myself an opportunity and surely Blockstream is a top notch opportunity. Just thinking that is leaded by Mr. Back gives me
